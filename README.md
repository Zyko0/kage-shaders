# Kage shaders

List of general-purpose shaders written in Kage for Ebitengine (https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)
More info about Kage (Ebitengine shading language): https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/shader.html
It starts with mine, mostly fullscreen and post-processing shaders, but anyone is welcome to open a PR.

# Notes

- Shaders are all written based on Kage's pixel-mode (https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/shader.html#Unit_mode)

# Contribute

Just open a PR!

- If some shaders are defining constants for actual parameters (that could be defined as uniforms), feel free to make a suggestion!
- Some features might be cut, some numbers might be tweaked wrongly based on what's visually expected when porting, so again feel free to contribute to fixes if something's not right!
