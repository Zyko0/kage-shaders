# Kage shaders

List of general-purpose shaders written in Kage for Ebitengine (https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)
More info about Kage (Ebitengine shading language): https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/shader.html
It starts with mine, mostly fullscreen and post-processing shaders, but anyone is welcome to open a PR.

For a gentle introduction to Kage (include tutorials and examples), please have a look at https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk

# Notes

- Shaders are all written based on Kage's pixel-mode (https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/shader.html#Unit_mode)

# Contribute

Just open a PR!

- If some shaders are defining constants for actual parameters (that could be defined as uniforms), feel free to make a suggestion!
- Some features might be cut, some numbers might be tweaked wrongly based on what's visually expected when porting, so again feel free to contribute with fixes if something is not right!
- Example applications? Why not!
